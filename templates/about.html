                    Nowadays, it is extremely difficult to find suitable accommodation in city areas if people search for it physically. 
                    On the other hand, the landlord also needs to rent the house. It can be difficult to find tenants just by hanging a lease sign on a building, and as a result, they lose money.
                     Moreover, this problem turns into terrible form when bachelorâ€™s want to find a home as their choice. An online common platform can play a vital role in this case. 
                     The purpose of the website is to develop a common web-based online platform for both tenants and house owners so that both tenants and landowners will mutually benefit from the system.
